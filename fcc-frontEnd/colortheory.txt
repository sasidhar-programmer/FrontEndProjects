Two colors that are opposite from each other on the color wheel are called complementary colors. 
If two complementary colors are combined, they produce gray. But when they are placed side-by-side, 
these colors produce strong visual contrast and appear brighter

It's better practice to choose one color as the dominant color, 
and use its complementary color as an accent to bring attention to certain content on the page.

With hex colors, 00 is 0% of that color, and FF is 100%. 
So #00FF00 translates to 0% red, 100% green, and 0% blue, 
and is the same as rgb(0, 255, 0).

A gradient is when one color transitions into another. The CSS linear-gradient function lets you 
control the direction of the transition along a line, and which colors are used.
